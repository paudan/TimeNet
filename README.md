# TimeNet
Implementation of TimeNet autoencoder for embedding time series. Based on 
_Malhotra et al. (2017) "TimeNet: Pre-trained deep recurrent neural network for time series classification"_, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08838

Implemented using TensorFlow 2.3.0 with Keras API. Experiments performed using time series data from http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/. 

## Usage
Can be run from command line using `main.py` script. Sample data is provided in `data` folder
